# GitHub (Source)

This package models GitHub data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/GitHub). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lx6ez7-x-s-n2JCnCi3SjG4XMmx9ysNUvaNCaWc3I_I/edit).

This package enriches your Fivetran data by doing the following:
* Adds descriptions to tables and columns that are synced using Fivetran
* Adds freshness tests to source data
* Adds column-level testing where applicable. For example, all primary keys are tested for uniqueness and non-null values.
* Models staging tables, which will be used in our transform package

## Models

This package contains staging models, designed to work simultaneously with our [GitHub modeling package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github).  The staging models:
* Remove any rows that are soft-deleted
* Name columns consistently across all packages:
    * Boolean fields are prefixed with `is_` or `has_`
    * Timestamps are appended with `_at`
    * ID primary keys are prefixed with the name of the table.  For example, the user table's ID column is renamed user_id.


## Installation Instructions
Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

Include in your `packages.yml`

```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/github_source
    version: [">=0.3.0", "<0.4.0"]
```

## Configuration
By default, this package will run using your target database and the `github` schema. If this is not where your GitHub data is (perhaps your gitHub schema is `Github_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  github_source:
    github_database: your_database_name
    github_schema: your_schema_name 
```

### Disabling Models
Your Github connector might not sync every table that this package expects. If your syncs exclude certain tables, it is because you either don't use that functionality in Github or have actively excluded some tables from your syncs.

If you do not have the `REPO_TEAM` table synced, add the following variable to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml
config-version: 2

vars:
    github__using_repo_team: false # by default this is assumed to be true
```

*Note: This package only integrates the above variable. If you'd like to disable other models, please create an [issue](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_github_source/issues) specifying which ones.*

## Database support
This package has been tested on BigQuery, Snowflake and Redshift.
